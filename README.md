Personal Resume Building Tool (WEB 115 Final Project - Fall 2018)

This project was created for a Web Programming & Development course which served as an introduction to the JavaScript language.  A working version is hosted at wcet3.waketech.edu/btgatewood/WEB115/project/finalProject.html.  Note: The previously mentioned version may not reflect the current state of this repository (last updated 11/27/18).

This code is free to use and modify if you so desire.  All I ask is that you share with me any improvements you make.  Also, I welcome any questions or suggestions regarding my work.

Thanks for checking out my project!
